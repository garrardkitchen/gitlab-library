Actions to implement:
- Using c# and .NET 9.0, create a console application
- Use the spectre.console when prompting for input
- prompt the user for the gitlab project to download
- prompt the user for the a name to use to create a new gitlab project
- write code that creates a new gitlab project
- Write the code that will download a git repository from a different gitlab project
- write the code to copy the files from the downloaded gitlab project into the local repo of the created gitlab project.
- If the path doesn't exist when you're going to copy the code over, you must create it
- Write the code that will perform a git commit and push. You can access the linux process and execute git commands this way
